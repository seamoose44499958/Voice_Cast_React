/*
    The two main methods that run the program are playAudio and getAudio. 
    getAudio fills the circular buffer while playAudio reads from the circular buffer.
    Audio is transferred through constant polling by the client as seen in the
    in the execute function. Both functions are concurrent but in different ways. getAudio() 
    is as basic as it gets. playAudio on the other hand will return a promise that is either empty
    or calls itself when the audio finishes playing. It has a lock(in the form of a boolean) so that 
    only one audio chunk can be played at once. If playAudio is locked or the buffer is empty it will return an 
    empty promise. The api consists of two parts, initializing the client as an audio listener and getting the audio.
    When initializing the audio the client gets an audio id(X-Audio-ID located in the header) through the /initialize_audio
    Post request. After, the client can get an audio chunk by doing a Get request with the X-Audio-ID header. The audio chunks 
    consists of a 16-bit PCM where each sample is separated by a ','. A linear ramp is already calculated by the server 
    at the front and the end of every audio chunk to prevent clicking. The audio can be started and stopped by the play button.
    Once audio is stopped the client will not continue to poll for new audio chunks. Audio will stop playing because
    the write index is equal to the read index. On an error everything is reset. The client will need to reinitialize the audio
    again and create a new audio context. The client can do this by pressing the button again(which will have changed color back 
    to the non playing state).
